## Project Abstract
This project demonstrates a cloud security monitoring solution using **AWS CloudTrail, Lambda, S3, and CloudWatch**. The solution automatically captures and processes security logs in AWS, ensuring real-time visibility of account activity, anomaly detection, and centralized logging.  

Key objectives:
- Capture all AWS API activity across regions
- Store logs securely in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled
- Process logs using AWS Lambda functions
- Monitor and visualize logs in CloudWatch
